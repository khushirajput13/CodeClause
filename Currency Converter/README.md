## Python Currency Converter

This is a Python program designed to convert currencies based on user input. 

<br>

## What I have learned from this project

* **Handling user input:** Gain experience using Python's `input` function to interact with the user and get information like the amount and currency codes.
* **Basic mathematical operations:** The conversion process involves basic mathematical operations like division and multiplication. 
* **Currency conversion logic:** Understand how to perform currency conversion considering exchange rates.

<br>

## Functionality

The program prompts the user to enter:

* The amount of money they want to convert.
* The currency code of the starting amount (e.g., USD, EUR).
* The currency code they want to convert to (e.g., USD, EUR).

**Note:** This is a basic implementation and uses a sample exchange rate dictionary.

## Running the program

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Download:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the program file (e.g., `main.py`), and execute it using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

4. **Follow the prompts:** The program will ask you to enter the amount, source currency code, and target currency code. Enter the values and press Enter after each input.

The program will then display the converted amount in the target currency.
